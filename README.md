This IoT connected floating trash trap uses a buoy that detects when trash collects in waterways like canals and rivers. It tracks the amount of trash collected, transmits real time data to the dashboard about its condition and timing for collection, enabling teams to be dispatched in a timely manner. No more relying on assumptions, this system reduces personnel need and ensures water is cleaned quicker by operating based on information.
